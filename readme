This program is designed to simulate a web server built in Java. 
It is utilizing Socket and ServerSocket, opening http connection to localhost.
Port is identified as 8000. User can choose any port depending on user's machine.


Instruction:
1. Run WebServerExample.java 
2. It will invoke the HttpRequest.java that is implemented using Thread
3. Go to Web Browser, type in http://localhost:8000 -> (8000 is the port number)
4. The console will prompt users to enter the HttpRequest-like message
   format: GET /index.html HTTP/1.0 (index.html is present in the current path)
   Type that format in the console and press enter
5. Go back to web browser and user will see the index.html welcome page
6. Response message will be shown in the console


Exception:
1. If user types a request with no GET as the first word, web browser will
   show: 501 Bad Request
   (Assuming in this program, we will only process GET request)
2. If user requests a page/object that is not present in the directory
   Example: GET /about.html HTTP/1.0 
   user will be presented with an error: 404: Page Not Found in the browser

Note:
1. Try to open multiple tabs and connect to the same localhost
2. When the program is running, avoid compiling the program again.
   If user wants to refresh the program, or tries different request, 
   simply refresh the web browser and the console will prompt user
   to enter a new request.
